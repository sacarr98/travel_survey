## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- To quickly find information about meditative techniques that can improve mental well-being
- To be encouraged to focus more on personal well-being by learning how simple it is to encorporate into everyday life
- To be able to easily navigate between pages display different well-being techniques

## Features

The website comprised of 5 pages, the index page, 3 informative pages, and a sign-up page.

## Future Implementations

In future I would like to create a login option in order to create a user network so users can encourage eachother on their journey in improved mental well-being.

### Accessibility

We have actively tried to ensure our website is accessible friendly as possible, we achieved this by:
- Using semantic HTML
- Ensuring sufficient colour contrast throughout the site and using easily readable fonts
- Providing information for screen readers where icons were used in place of text, for example for our social media icons in the footer

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

Python

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Git - for version control
Github - to save and store files

Click on "Settings" on the navigation bar under the repository title.
Click on "Pages" in the left hand navigation panel.
Under "Source", choose which branch to deploy. This should be Main for newer repositories (older repositories may still use Master).
Choose which folder to deploy from, usually "/root".
Click "Save", then wait for it to be deployed. It can take some time for the page to be fully deployed.
Your URL will be displayed above "Source".
